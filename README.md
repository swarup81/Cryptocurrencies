# Cryptocurrencies

# Purpose:
This project aims to create an analysis for the clients preparing to enter the cryptocurrency market. We have created a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market, how they could be grouped and established a classification system for this new investment.
Since there is unknown output for what clients are looking for, we will use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we have decided on a clustering algorithm. We have used data visualizations to share our findings with the board.
